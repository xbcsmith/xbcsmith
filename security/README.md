# Secure Software Supply Chain Summit

Secure Software Supply Chain Summit - Laurie Williams

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). Where are you in your journey toward producing an SBOM?  Where are you in your journey toward consuming/using the SBOMs of components and products you use?  What challenges have you faced in SBOM production or use and how have you tried to overcome these challenges?  Are you creating a VEX?  How?

Compliance.  What standards do you follow and/or use for guidance for software development practice adoption to reduce software supply chain risk?  (Examples:  SSFD, NIST 800-161, SLSA, S2C2F) How is compliance going (e.g. producing SBOM or self-attestation)? 

Malicious commits.  How can malicious commits be detected? What do you think signals a suspicious/malicious commit?  What role does the ecosystem play in detecting malicious commits?

Build Infrastructure.  What is being done (or should be being done) to secure the build and deploy process/tooling pipeline (a.k.a SLSA practices)?  Are you working toward reproducible builds?  Do you run your own build server or cloud services?  Do those who use GitHub actions use self-runners?  Are you seeing increased attention by security researchers and attackers on weaknesses in GitHub actions?

Culture. What changes have you made to support supply chain security/executive order compliance?  What do you think is needed for nurturing such a security-benefiting  culture?

LLMs and Supply Chain Security: How are you leveraging the recent advances in ML/AI in securing your software supply chain?  What are policies around the use of code generation tools in your company?  Do you have a process for choosing safe/secure third-party AI models?

## Keynote

For most ecosystems the day of new tooling is over.

We should focus on integrating new tools into existing ecosystems.

Changing developer workflow is the hardest thing we could ever do

We should use entrenched tooling to take advantage of the new security capabilities.

## SBOMs

Sonatype creates SBOMs and stores them in their SBOM manager

EOL CVE

Provenance is the key

gitoid

December/January Code Freeze to work on Tech Debt

Never let a good crisis go to waste (crisis as an opportunity)

Product Liability Act

AI in the Supply Chain - Looking for a problem to a solution 

Threat Model Bot???

Vibe Coding... the AI has become really good at creating code that looks like it is good.
